# What is the application? 

For our project we created a web application similar to Wikipedia and Testudo combined for the College of Information Studies at the University of Maryland, College Park. We’ve decided to call this platform the WikiPINGdia. We chose this name when we came up with the project in our INST335 class by combining the name of the platform Wikipedia with our professor Ping Wang. This website will feature information on the Information Science major. To be more specific, it will include links to textbooks and course materials needed for class, syllabi, test and quiz banks, courses provided, reviews and evaluations on courses and professors, “tweets” of updates, other social media updates, jobs and internships offered, etc. This information will be created partly by a team that uploads the information that requires department approval and partly by a collaborative wiki that will contribute to reviews, descriptions, file uploads, etc..

# Why is the application necessary (or useful)?

In the personal experience of ourselves and our friends as information science, we often find information unreliable, or simply spread over too many sources (Testudo, ratemyprofessors.com, iSchool website, etc.) to be efficient or easy to find. In addition, a lot of the information you can find is not extensive and could be a lot more in depth. Giving information science its own space to be elaborated on seemed necessary, and our app gave teachers and TAs a new voice as well, something unseen in other similair apps. The wiki portion allows for extensive input of users of all kinds.

# Who are the application users?

Our web app will serve not only the students of the information science department, but also the professors, TAs, and even prospective students considering applying to the major. Most of our data will be simple. Information about classes and the department will be sourced from Testudo, various social media departments, and the iSchool website and information such as profiles, reviews, and file uploads will be handled by user contribution to wiki pages and verified uploads to profiles (ie a teacher updating their own profile on the website). In order to contribute to the wiki aspect of our web application, or edit your profile as a teacher or TA, you will have to be verified as a UMD student, so we will also have to collect user information of those who wish to contribute.
